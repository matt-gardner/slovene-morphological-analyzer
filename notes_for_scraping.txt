div to look for on rtvslo.si: <div class="lead_menu_item_details">

once you go to the news article: <div id="newsbody">, then go to <div
class="info">, and get all following text.

or, perhaps better, just grab the text from all of the <p> tags.  It looks like
those are only used for the article body.
